# Spring AI demo

The repo contains a quick demo on how to use the new [Spring AI library](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai)
to communicate with chatGpt.

This demo currently only tests translating text using chatGpt, but there are many other applications and AI models that
can be configured to be used
